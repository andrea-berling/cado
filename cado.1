.SH DESCRIPTION
Cado permits to delegate capabilities to users.
Cado is a capability based sudo. Sudo allows authorized users to run programs as root (or as another user),
cado allows authorized users to run programs with specific (ambient) capabilities.

Cado is more selective than sudo, users can be authorized to have only specific capabilities (and not others).

\fIcapability_list\fR is a comma separated list of capability names or capability masks (exadecimal numbers).
For brevity, the \fBcap_\fR prefix of capability names can be omitted (e.g. \fBnet_admin\fR and \fBcap_net_admin\fR
have the same meaning).

If it is allowed for the current user to run processes with the requested capabilities, the user is asked to
type their password (or to authenticate themselves as required by pam).
Once the authentication succeeds, \fBcado\fR executes the command granting the required ambient capabilities.

The file /etc/cado.conf (see \fBcado.conf\fR(5)) defines which capabilities can be provided by \fBcado\fR to each user.
Cado itself is not a setuid executable, it uses the capability mechanism and it has an option to
set its own capabilities. So after each change in the /etc/cado.conf, the capability set should be
recomputed by root using the command \fBcado -s\fR or \fBcado --setcap\fR.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-v
.TQ
\fB\-\-verbose

(in case of -s) the set of capabilities assigned to \fBcado.conf\fR itself.
.TP
\fB\-q
.TQ
\fB\-\-quiet
do not fail in case the user asks for unavailable capabilities,  \fBcado.conf\fR in this case grants the intersection between the
set of requested cababilities and the set of allowed capabilities
.TP
\fB\-s
.TQ
\fB\-\-setcap
\fBcado\fR computes the miminal set of capability required by itself and sets the file capability of the cado executable.
.TP
\fB\-h
